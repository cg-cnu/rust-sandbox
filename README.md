hello rust

## hello_world

* Create a file `main.rs`.
* `fn` denotes function.
* `main` is the first function executed by rust.
* `println!` is a macro. More about it later.
* `rustc main.rs` will build the file and generate a `main` binary.
* Executing `./main` Prints `Hello World!` to stdout.

## hello_cargo

* `cargo` is the build system and package manager.
* `cargo new hello_cargo --bin` will create a new executable application.
* `Cargo.toml` will track project info and dependencies.
* `src/` will contain the source code.
* `cargo build` will build the project.
* Creates...
    + `Cargo.lock` file will maintain the dependencies versions, no need to touch this ever.
    + `target/` contains the build files generated
        * Contains...
            + `debug/` constains the generated binary files
                * Takes less time to compile 
                * No many optimizations are done
            + `release/` contains the release files generated by using the `--release` flag.
                * Takes more time to compile
                * Lot of final optimizations are done
* `cargo run` will build and run the project. Will just run if its already bild.
