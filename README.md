hello rust

## hello_world

* Create a file `main.rs`.
* `fn` denotes function.
* `main` is the first function executed by rust.
* `println!` is a macro. More about it later.
* `rustc main.rs` will build the file and generate a `main` binary.
* Executing `./main` Prints `Hello World!` to stdout.

## hello_cargo

* `cargo` is the build system and package manager.
* `cargo new hello_cargo ` will create a new rust project.
    + `--bin` project for executable application
    + defaults to rust library
* `Cargo.toml` will track project info and dependencies.
* `src/` will contain the source code.
    + `main.rs` the main file executed by cargo
    + Uses `lib.rs` for libraries.
* `cargo build` will build the project.
    * Creates...
        + `Cargo.lock` file will maintain the dependencies versions, no need to touch this ever.
        + `target/` contains the build files generated
            * Contains...
                + `debug/` constains the generated binary files
                    * Takes less time to compile 
                    * No many optimizations are done
                + `release/` contains the release files generated by using the `--release` flag.
                    * Takes more time to compile
                    * Lot of final optimizations are done
* `cargo run` will build and run the project. Will just run if its already build.
* `cargo doc --open` will open the documentation for all the packages used.
